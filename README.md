# ML-practice

Practice Work with ML Models and sci-kit learn, Including:

 - Simple Linear Regression in supervised ML models
 - Logistic Regression to train a supervised ML model capable of identifying numbers from pixelated, black and white images
 - K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) in detecting whether or not someone has diabetes
 - Exploring K-Means Clustering, developing an unsupervised ML model using K-Means to 
    1. Cluster geographic data for retail store locations
    2. Compress images by clustering an image's color scale into 16 common colors
 - Decision Tree to predict whether or not customers will pay off their loans and whether or not to accept loan requests
 - Random Forest to identify species of different flowers
 - SVM Model for simple classification
